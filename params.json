{"name":"Idem","tagline":"OAuth 2 Authorization Server","body":"# idem\r\n\r\nOAuth 2.0 is an open authorization protocol which enables applications(or services) to access each other's data. OAuth 2.0 can be used either to create an application that can read user data from another application, or an application that enables other applications to access its user data. Oauth2 consists of the following components\r\n - User / Resource Owner – an entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.\r\n - Resource Server – server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access token. \r\n - Client – An application making requests to protected resources on behalf of the owner. It can be a web app server, a mobile app, or a client side (e.g. javascript) application.\r\n - Authorization Server – Server issuing access tokens to client after successfully authentication the resource owner and obtaining authorization.\r\n\r\n[[images/oauth2.png]]\r\n\r\nThe sequence of interactions are like\r\n\r\n1. Client redirects user to the authorization server. User login and approve client access to the resource. \r\n2. Authorization server redirects back to client with the access code. \r\n3. Client exchange the access code with an access token from the authorization server. \r\n4. Client uses the access token to invoke API’s on a micro service. \r\n5. Each micro service is free to interpret the scopes in the token. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
